# Abstract

The hallmark of episodic memory is recollecting multiple perceptual details tied to a specific spatial-temporal context. In order to remember an event, it is therefore necessary to integrate such details into a coherent representation during initial encoding. Here we tested how the brain encodes and binds multiple, distinct kinds of features in parallel, and how this evolves over time during the event itself. We analyzed data from 27 subjects who learned a series of objects uniquely associated with a color, a panoramic scene location, and an emotional sound while undergoing fMRI. By modeling neural activity at event onset and event offset, we were able to test how the neural signatures of individual features as well as the integrated event change over the course of encoding. We observed a striking dissociation between early and late encoding processes: sensory and left inferior frontal signals at event onset tracked the amount of detail subsequently recalled and were dissociable based on distinct remembered features. Memory-related neural activity shifted to the hippocampus at event offset, which was particularly sensitive to binding item color and sound associations within a spatial framework. These results provide evidence of simultaneous feature-specific neural responses at the start of episodic encoding and show that the hippocampus acts to integrate these features into a spatially-coherent experience at an event transition.
